SuperMarioBros is a classic platform video game where the player controls Mario, the protagonist, as he navigates through various levels filled with obstacles, enemies, and power-ups. 

The goal of this project is to develop an agent capable of playing the classic Super Mario Bros game using Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) agent to learn a policy for navigating through the game levels, avoiding obstacles, and maximizing the score. 
The agent interacts with the game environment provided by the gym-super-mario-bros library, which simulates the original game. 

This project demonstrates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to solve complex decision-making problems in the domain of classic video games.
